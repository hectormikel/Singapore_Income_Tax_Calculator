# Singapore Income Tax Rates

**Version 1.0.0**

This program calculates the income tax due for individuals who have worked in Singapore. This refers to the information published as of July 2020 on the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore’s website: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/.  
The user must declare whether he is a Singaporean citizen, Permanent Resident, or a foreigner employed in Singapore for at least 183 days. After which, user inputs his gross income for the tax year. The program returns the user’s tax amount due and the net income (gross income less income tax).

Income Tax Rates
 

Income tax rates depend on an individual's tax residency status. You will be treated as a tax resident for a particular Year of Assessment (YA) if you are a: 
a.	Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) who resides in Singapore except for temporary absences; or
b.	Foreigner who has stayed / worked in Singapore (excludes director of a company) for 183 days or more in the year preceding the YA.
Otherwise, you will be treated as a non-resident of Singapore for tax purposes.
Singapore's personal income tax rates for resident taxpayers are progressive. This means higher income earners pay a proportionately higher tax, with the current highest personal income tax rate at 22%.
